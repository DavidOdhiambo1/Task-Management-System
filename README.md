**Project Idea: Task Management System**

**1. Project Description:**
Develop a Task Management System that allows users to create, organize, and manage their tasks. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as setting priorities and due dates. Users can register, log in, and access their tasks securely.

**2. Requirements:**

**Frontend: React**
- User Authentication:
  - Sign up, login, and logout functionalities.
- Task Management:
  - Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
  - Prioritize tasks (high, medium, low).
  - Set due dates for tasks.
  - Filter and sort tasks based on priority and due date.
- Responsive Design:
  - Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface for various devices.

**Backend: Python/Flask with SQLite Database**
- User Management:
  - User registration, login, and authentication.
- Task Management:
  - CRUD operations for tasks.
  - Store task details such as title, description, priority, due date, and status.
- Database:
  - Use SQLite for simplicity, but consider migrating to a more robust database for scalability.
- API Endpoints:
  - Define API endpoints for user authentication and task management.

**3. User Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
- Tasks can be prioritized (high, medium, low) and assigned due dates.
- The system is responsive and works well on various devices.
- Data is securely stored, and user privacy is maintained.

**4. Components for the Frontend:**
- **Authentication Components:**
  - Sign-up form
  - Login form
  - Logout button
- **Task Management Components:**
  - Task list display
  - Task creation form
  - Task details/edit form
  - Priority and due date selectors

**5. ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the Database:**
- **User Table:**
  - user_id (Primary Key)
  - username
  - password_hash
- **Task Table:**
  - task_id (Primary Key)
  - user_id (Foreign Key)
  - title
  - description
  - priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - due_date
  - status (e.g., In Progress, Completed)

**Additional Details:**
- **Security:**
  - Use bcrypt or a similar library for password hashing.
  - Implement token-based authentication.
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for backend API endpoints.
  - Integration tests for frontend components.
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- **Logging:**
  - Implement logging for tracking errors and system activities.
- **Documentation:**
  - Provide documentation for API endpoints and frontend components.

This project allows a mid-level software engineer to showcase their skills in both frontend and backend development, 
user authentication, database design, and project documentation. 
It covers a range of technologies commonly used in full-stack development, providing a holistic learning experience.
